Real GDP growth is projected to improve gradually to 2 percent in \n2024–25 supported by public investment, spillovers from the ongoing LNG expansion project, \nand strong tourism. Medium-term growth is expected to accelerate to 4¾ percent on average, \nboosted by the significant LNG production expansion and initial gains from implementing \nreforms guided by the Third National Development Strategy (NDS3). Headline inflation will \nlikely ease to 1 percent in 2024 and converge to around 2 percent over the medium term.  \nWith lower hydrocarbon prices, both the current account and fiscal surpluses narrowed in \n2023, to 17 percent of GDP and 5½ percent of GDP, respectively. The twin surpluses \nmoderated further in 2024. Over the medium, as Qatar’s LNG production expands massively, \nboth the current and fiscal accounts will likely remain in surpluses, albeit declining as a share \nof GDP, as hydrocarbon prices are projected to fall. \nBanks are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, with the capital adequacy ratio of close to \n20 percent and return on equity of 14½ percent, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. \nSince the implementation of QCB measures to reduce banks’ net short-term foreign liabilities, \nbanks’ non-resident deposits declined significantly, and banks have lengthened the average \nmaturity and diversified further the sources of foreign funding. The sector-wide NPL ratio \nremained broadly unchanged at slightly below 4 percent and the provisioning coverage ratio is \nrelatively high at above 80 percent.     \nQatar has started to implement the ambitious Third National Development Strategy (NDS3) to \nbuild a more diversified, knowledge-based and private sector-driven economy. Guided by \nNDS3, reform momentum has strengthened significantly, including to attract and retain high-\nskilled expatriate workers, foster innovation, promote public-private partnerships, and further \nimprove the business efficiency. Qatar is well positioned to leverage digitalization and AI for \nproductivity gains, and the nation’s climate agenda is advancing.  \nRisks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Main downside risks stem from the global \nheadwinds, including a sharper-than-expected global growth slowdown, increased volatility in \nglobal financial conditions and commodity prices, and further worsening of geopolitical \ntensions. The regional conflict has had limited impact on Qatar but adds further to the \ndownside risks through lower tourism and capital inflows, and more volatile hydrocarbon \n1 Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff \nteam visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments \nand policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.",

              "content": "QATAR \n66 \nINTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND \nAnnex VII. Data Issues \nTable VII. 1. Qatar: Data Adequacy Assessment for Surveillance \nRationale for staff assessment. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance but with shortcomings. Data frequency, timeliness and coverage should be improved. \nNational accounts. Data sources used to compile quarterly estimates of GDP at current and constant prices need to be broadened to enhance accuracy. GDP by \nexpenditure needs to be more up to date–by component annual data lag the headline (in current prices) or are available only up to 2018 (in constant prices). For the latter, \nthe quarterly data should also provide a breakdown (only the headline number is produced). Timeliness was an issue also for GDP by activity data (2023Q4 GDP data were \nreleased in early-September 2024. 2024Q1–Q2 GDP data were released in early-December 2024 and 2024Q3 GDP data at end-December 2024).  \nPrices. Monthly Consumer and Producer Price Indices (CPI, PPI), and real estate price data are published timely. CPI weights need to be updated more frequently. The \nMinistry of Justice publishes Weekly Newsletter with daily property transaction data by type which can benefit from greater consistency to better inform surveillance.  \nGovernment finance. The authorities are implementing the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) which enables compilation of accrual fiscal \naccounts. An IMF Technical Assistance (TA) mission in 2019 supported transition to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2014. Transparency was enhanced by the \npublication of annual budget documents and quarterly budget performance reports for the central government with headline budget and debt numbers––the reports \ncould include more line items and quarterly debt numbers. The prospectus for sovereign euro bond issuance includes detailed information on revenue and expenditure line \nitems, and external bonds, but publication is infrequent. For the 2023 budget, a press release was published and, instead of the regular budget statement, the Minister \nprovided relevant information at the press conference. The format of the 2024 budget statement was similar to the 2023 budget press release. The coverage of financial \noperations should be broadened to the general government including the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA).  \nExternal sector. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) reports quarterly balance of payments data timely, following the fifth edition of the balance of payments manual (BPM5). \nThe financial account has been developed and coverage improved for major public corporations, the Qatar Financial Center Authority, and the Qatar Stock Exchange. \nHowever, financial account data are aggregated. The authorities need to improve coordination to enhance the coverage of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flow data (which \ndeviate significantly from FDI commitment data). A 2017 TA mission helped develop a quarterly survey for nonfinancial sector data aimed at producing a quarterly \nInternational Investment Position (IIP) statement. However, following the TA the authorities have continued to face capacity constraints in providing comprehensive IIP data \nto the IMF. More work is needed to ensure comprehensive data coverage, collection, and granularity—efforts should strengthen to allow Qatar's participation in key \nsurveys like the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS).  \nMonetary and financial sectors. The QCB submits the monetary and financial statistics (MFS) for the central bank and other depository corporations based on the \nStandardized Report Forms (SRFs). The MFS data are published in the International Financial Statistics on a timely basis. Qatar also reports data on some key series and \nindicators of the Financial Access Survey (FAS), including mobile money and the two indicators of the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals, but does not report data by \ngender. The QCB reports the Financial Soundness Indicators as part of the National Summary Data Page, but does not submit to the IMF, and 4 indicators are missing \nrelative to the IMF’s list of Core Financial Soundness indicators. \nChanges since the last Article IV consultation. The Planning and Statics Authority was replaced by a newly established National Planning Council to strengthen reform \nimplementation stipulated in the Third National Development Strategy, including to improve statistics. The statistics authority is in the process of producing new supply \nand use tables to improve the consistency of GDP estimates. A household survey is being finalized, which will be used to update CPI weights. The domestic “FDI ecosystem” \nhas been fully mapped to identify additional sources of input data including business registration platforms (i.e., QFC, QSTP, QFZA, Media city) which will increase survey \nframe from current 130+ entities to 2000+ entities. \nCorrective actions and capacity development priorities. Enhance awareness across government entities of the data gaps and international best practices. Implement \nrecommendations made by the above-mentioned TAs. Encourage the authorities to seek the Institute for Capacity Development (ICD) training, additional Statistics \nDepartments (STA) TAs, and participate in the workshop on the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) to be organized by the newly established Riyadh Regional \nOffice. Urge the National Planning Council and National Statistics Center to coordinate efforts across relevant government entities on statistics including consolidation of \nscattered data, submission to the IMF, and broader publication.  \nUse of data and/or estimates different from official statistics in the Article IV consultation. IIP data are unavailable, including QIA’s assets under management. Staff \nrely on different data sources as needed––it estimates external debt data (for non-bank private sector and public sector debt outside of the central government), uses \nalternative data sources for FDI, and relies on commercially available bank-level data. \nOther data gaps. A more granular forward-looking calendar of key data releases would aid surveillance and enhance transparency. By maturity assets and liabilities data \nand by sector non-performing loans (NPLs) data will enhance the assessment of banking sector risks for surveillance. Data on enterprises, particularly small and medium-\nsized enterprises (SMEs), and on climate change adaptation and mitigation would help inform surveillance.   \nNational \nAccounts\nPrices\nGovernment \nFinance \nStatistics\nExternal Sector \nStatistics\nMonetary and \nFinancial \nStatistics\nInter-sectoral \nConsistency \nMedian Rating\nB\nB\nB\nC\nB\nB\nB\nCoverage\nB\nB\nB\nC\nB\nB\nB\nC\nA\nB\nB\nConsistency\nB\nB\nB\nFrequency and Timeliness\nB\nA\nB\nA\nA\nA\nB\nC\nD\nData Quality Characteristics\nGranularity 3/\nData Adequacy Assessment Rating 1/\nB\nQuestionnaire Results 2/\nAssessment\nDetailed Questionnaire Results\nNote: When the questionnaire does not include a question on a specific dimension of data quality for a sector, the corresponding cell is blank.\n1/ The overall data adequacy assessment is based on staff's assessment of the adequacy of the country’s data for conducting analysis and formulating policy advice, and takes into consideration \ncountry-specific characteristics.\n2/ The overall questionnaire assessment and the assessments for individual sectors reported in the heatmap are based on a standardized questionnaire and scoring system (see IMF Review of the \nFramework for Data Adequacy Assessment for Surveillance, January 2024, Appendix I).\n3/ The top cell for \"Granularity\" of Government Finance Statistics shows staff's assessment of the granularity of the reported government operations data, while the bottom cell shows that of public \ndebt statistics.

Welcome efforts to strengthen fiscal institutions pave the way to adopt a full-fledged \nmedium-term fiscal framework (MTFF) with enhanced fiscal risk management:  \n• \nMTFF with strengthened budget execution and risk assessment. The extension of the \nmedium-term budget to five years and progress in introducing program-based budgeting are \nencouraging. Staff also welcomed the authorities’ initiative to enhance macroeconomic \nprojections to support the medium-term budget update. These efforts pave the way to \nintroduce a full-fledged MTFF, anchored by the PIH benchmark, to strengthen fiscal \nsustainability and ensure priority spending. The MTFF should guide and be integrated into the \nannual budget process, with performance-based allocations and strengthened budget execution \nto ensure compliance. The MTFF and annual budget should be complemented by regular fiscal \nrisk assessments, including those stemming from Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs, see below), \nand underpinned by enhanced fiscal transparency. IMF technical assistance (TA) on the MTFF \ncan support the authorities’ efforts.   \n• \nManaging fiscal risks from PPPs. Around QAR10 billion (US$2¾ billion) of PPP projects are in the \npipeline, focusing on health, education, hospitality, and infrastructure. It is critical to manage \npotential fiscal risks (including contingent liabilities) by adopting an appropriate risk-sharing and \nmonitoring framework, underpinned by transparency and strong governance.

The authorities plan to resume gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024. Despite a \nmoderate fiscal loosening in 2023 amid slower growth, the NHPB is estimated to remain consistent \nwith the level suggested by the Permanent \nIncome Hypothesis (PIH), a benchmark to \nensure intergenerational equity (Text \nFigure 9). 4 The 2024 budget envisages \nspending cuts worth 2 ppts of GDP from \nthe 2023 outturn, mostly in capital \nexpenditure, while the fiscal outturn up to \nthe third quarter of 2024 suggests that the \noverall expenditure cuts could be milder \nthan budgeted, closer to 1½ ppts pf GDP. \nNonetheless, the fiscal stance is still likely \nto tighten, with the NHPB projected to \nimprove by around ¾ ppt of non-\nhydrocarbon GDP. The 2025 budget \nenvisages broadly prudent spending plans \namid the growth rebound. The medium-\nterm budget has been updated to reflect \nNDS3 spending needs, where continued \ngradual consolidation is expected.  \n14.      Staff welcomed the authorities’ \ncommitment to continued fiscal \nprudence and recommended adopting a \nfiscal anchor to support the strategy. \nThe PIH-based benchmark can serve as a \nmedium-term fiscal anchor to ensure intergenerational equity. Higher-than-expected hydrocarbon \nrevenues should be saved to strengthen fiscal buffers. During economic downturns, some fiscal \nspace could be deployed to provide targeted support, while a credible plan should be in place to \nguide the NHPB to return to the PIH-based fiscal anchor (with a view to eventually introducing a \nfiscal rule). 5 The assessment of fiscal stance would be more accurate if expenditures by government \nrelated entities (GREs) are also accounted for. The PIH-based fiscal anchor should be updated \nperiodically as the global energy transition unfolds to ensure realistic long-term oil price \nassumptions. \n15.      Revenue diversification should accelerate to enhance resilience and modernize the tax \nsystem. The highly uncertain global energy transition is now compounded by rising geopolitical \n \n4 See Annex VI of the 2022 Article IV Staff Report for Qatar and Chapter II of the 2019 Selected Issues for more \ndetailed discussion of the PIH analysis.  \n5 See Chapter II of the 2019 Selected Issues for greater discussion. \nText Figure 9.

The QCB continued to follow the US Federal Reserve \nin setting policy rates and improved liquidity management through calibrated T-bill issuance. As \nhydrocarbon prices moderated, the associated liquidity to the banking sector decreased. Bank \nlending to domestic private sector eased to 5 percent (year-on-year) in 2023 while credit to the \npublic sector contracted after major World Cup-related infrastructure projects were completed. \nDomestic credit accelerated in 2024 so far as private credit to services and trade strengthened, and \npositive public credit growth resumed to support investment projects. Credit to the real estate \nsector contracted (year-on-year) earlier in 2024 but grew from August.  \n5.      \nThe current account surplus narrowed mainly on lower hydrocarbon prices (Figure 3 \nand Text Figure 5). The current account surplus shrank from 27 percent of GDP in 2022 to a still \nsizeable 17 percent of GDP in 2023. The trade surplus moderated further in 2024 as hydrocarbon \nexport continued to decline. On the other hand, tourism and transportation services were buoyant, \nand remittance outflows remained stable despite a rise in expatriate employment. The QCB’s \ninternational reserves rose gradually to US$53.8 billion in November 2024, strengthening the reserve \ncoverage (projected to reach 62 percent of the ARA metric by end 2024). This is complemented by \nthe sizeable foreign assets held by Qatar Investment Authority (QIA), estimated to have exceeded \n200 percent of GDP in 2023, through which a significant share of the hydrocarbon windfalls is \ninvested abroad. The external position is assessed to be moderately stronger than the level \nsuggested by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies (Annex II). \n-12\n-8\n-4\n0\n4\n8\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nFood\nHousing\nTransport\nRecreation\nOther\nOverall\nInflation by Sector\n(Percentage point)\n2013-23 average\n-10\n-5\n0\n5\n10\n-120\n-60\n0\n60\n120\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\nProducer price\nReal wage (right)\nProducer Price and Real Wage Inflation\n(Percent, year on year)",
